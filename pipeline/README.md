# Hamoye Stage G Open Source - Group05 Used Car

* It has been a 5 months intensive journey in Hamoye Internship program. It is a thing of joy that we are in the last stage of the internship which is <b> Stage G.</b> In order to practicalize what we have learnt, as usual we are saddled with this project of analyzing a used car dataset. The dataset is sourced from kaggle. Link to the dataset is [link](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data) 

# Kaggle Project Description
## Context

Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale, yet it's very difficult to collect all of them in the same place. I built a scraper for a school project and expanded upon it later to create this dataset which includes every used vehicle entry within the United States on Craigslist.

# Content

This data is scraped every few months, it contains most all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like <b> price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories.</b> For ML projects, consider feature engineering on location columns such as long/lat. For previous listings, check older versions of the dataset.

# Problem Statement

* Craiglist being world leading company dealing on used cars, there is massive information about used cars in craiglist website and databases. The major challenge of any Analyst trying to handle craiglist data is that it is spread across various locations in US. So, how can we analyze this dataset to get useful business insights about used cars in USA? Can a machine learning model to built using this dataset? These are few of many questions that we want to find answers to in this project.

# Project Objectives
* To understand the underlying patterns in various features of the dataset.
* To generate meaningful business insights from the dataset.
* To generate a preprocessed dataset that can be used for ML modelling.
* To build a ML model that can predict the price of used cars in USA.
* To build a ML workflow pipeline for this project.
